# Movies Recommender System

## Objective
The project aims to train a machine learning algorithm using the MovieLens dataset. The objective is to develop a movie recommendation system by implementing a regularized model that accounts for both movie and user effects.

## Process
Recommender systems are designed to identify content that may interest a user. These systems are widely utilized by businesses in sectors like movies, books, music, and restaurants, as well as in various applications, to target users with similar tastes. Specifically, a movie recommender system predicts the likelihood that a user who has watched a certain movie will be interested in another movie. This prediction is based on the user's movie preferences and how these preferences align with those of other users.
